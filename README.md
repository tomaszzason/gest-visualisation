# Weather Visualization App

A web application that visualizes mean temperature forecasts for selected cities using data from NOAA's GEFS files. The backend is built with FastAPI and MongoDB, while the frontend is developed using React and Recharts.

## Features

- Show mean temperatures for all forecasts by city and date. (00, 06, 12, 18)  - corresponding to the four forecasts published each day, every six hours.
- Compare mean temperatures by forecast and city.

## TODO
1. New chart - compare forecasts using BarChart
2. Heating Degree Days (HDD) calculation
3. Integration with Kafka
4. Read EPS forecast https://data.ecmwf.int/forecasts/
